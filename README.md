# Sunergy Optimizer _[in development]_

This work explores the application of machine learning for time series forecasting in home automation systems. 
Specifically, we focus on predicting solar power generation and household energy consumption while prioritizing user privacy and computational efficiency. 
The goal is to help users optimize their energy use by providing insights on surplus energy produced within the home on the Home Assistant Dashboard.
